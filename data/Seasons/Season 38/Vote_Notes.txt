Notes:
^1  Tribal Council resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those involved in the tie.
^2   A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, however, no votes were cast against its user.
^3  This castaway used an Extra Vote advantage, allowing them to vote twice at Tribal Council.
^4  A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
^5  Instead of a traditional vote, the person who won the Immunity Challenge, Chris, would choose someone to take with them into the Final Three. He chose to give the Immunity Necklace to Julie and bring Gavin to the Final Three. The remaining two castaways, Chris and Rick, would compete in a fire-making challenge to determine the last finalist.
