Notes:
^1 Tribal Council resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those involved in the tie.
^2 Richard and Rudy did not vote as they could only vote for were each other. By virtue of winning the final Immunity Challenge, only Kelly voted.
