Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.
^2 As Carl drew a package containing no buff, he was exiled without a tribe. Because of this, he did not attend Tribal Council and was immune for the episode.
^3 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
^4 Carl used the Idol Nullifier on Dan, canceling out Dan's idol.
^5 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, however, no votes were cast against its user.
^6 Instead of a traditional vote, the person who won the Immunity Challenge, Nick, would choose someone to take with them into the Final Three. He chose Angelina. The remaining two castaways, Kara and Mike, would compete in a fire-making challenge to determine the last finalist.
