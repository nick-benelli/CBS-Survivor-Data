^6  Dan was ejected from the game because of repeated inappropriate touching. No vote occurred for his removal and he would not be part of the jury.
^7  Dean used the Idol Nullifier on Janet, canceling out Janet's idol.
^8  Instead of a traditional vote, the person who won the Immunity Challenge, Noura, would take someone with them to the Final Three. She chose Tommy. The remaining two castaways, Dean and Lauren, would compete in a fire-making challenge to determine the last finalist.
