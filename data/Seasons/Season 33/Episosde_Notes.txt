Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.
^2 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
^3 David drew the odd-colored rock during the teams formation, and as a result automatically joined the winning team on reward without competing.
^4 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, however, no votes were cast against its user.
^5 The vote resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote would commence.
^6 Per Survivor rules, in case of a deadlock tie, the non-immmune players would have an open discussion to eliminate one of the tied players. If no consensus is reached, the non-immune castaways would be forced to draw rocks.
^7 Jay used his Reward Steal to steal David's reward. He picked Adam and David to join him on the reward.
^8 The Legacy Advantage was played, negating all votes against its user.
