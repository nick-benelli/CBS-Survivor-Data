Notes:^1 Tribal Council resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those involved in the tie.
^2 Julie quit the game, therefore the Tribal Council for that night was cancelled.
^3  A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
