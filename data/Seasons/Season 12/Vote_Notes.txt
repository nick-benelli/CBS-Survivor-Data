Notes:^1 Due to the odd number of players at the time of the tribe switch, Bruce, the odd person out, was sent to Exile Island, and rejoined the game as a member of Casaya, replacing Melinda and evening the tribes at 7-7.
^2 Casaya was given the opportunity to send one member of La Mina to Exile Island, making that player skip from Tribal Council. They selected Sally.
^3 Bruce was evacuated from the game due to severe gastrointestinal problems. No vote occurred for his removal.
^4 Per Survivor rules, a fire-making challenge would be held between the tied players in case of a deadlock tie in the final four Tribal Council. The fire-making challenge would be shown in the following episode.
^5 Aras and Terry did not vote as they could only vote for were each other. By virtue of winning the final Immunity Challenge, only Danielle voted.
