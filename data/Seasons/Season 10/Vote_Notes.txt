Notes:^1 Because they were not picked to be on a tribe, Jonathan and Wanda were automatically eliminated. No vote occurred for their removal.
^2 Tribal Council resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those involved in the tie.
^3 Because Ulong was down to its last two members, a fire-making challenge was held to determine the elimination. Bobby Jon lost, eliminating him from the game.
^4 Janu quit the game at Tribal Council, therefore the vote that night was cancelled.
^5 Per Survivor rules, a fire-making challenge would be held between the tied players in case of a deadlock tie in the final four Tribal Council.
^6 Ian and Katie did not vote as they could only vote for were each other. By virtue of winning the final Immunity Challenge, only Tom voted.
