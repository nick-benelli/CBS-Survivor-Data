Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.
^2 Rarotonga was initially declared the sole winner of the reward, but after reviewing challenge footage, it was found that Puka Puka also finished in the exact same time as Rarotonga. With this, both tribes shared the reward reserved only for the first placing tribe.
^3 Aitutaki was instructed to pick a member of Rarotonga who would join them in their reward and be exempted from the vote at Tribal Council. They selected Nate.
^4 Per Survivor rules, a fire-making challenge would be held between the tied players in case of a deadlock tie in the final four Tribal Council.
