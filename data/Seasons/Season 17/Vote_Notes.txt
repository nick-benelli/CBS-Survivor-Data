Notes:^1 Due to the odd number of players at the time of the tribe switch, Sugar, the odd person out, was sent to Exile Island, and rejoined the game as a member of Fang, replacing Jacquie and evening the tribes at 7-7.
^2 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
^3 Per Survivor rules, a fire-making challenge would be held between the tied players in case of a deadlock tie in the final four Tribal Council.
