Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.

^3 Jeff tempted the winners of the Reward Challenge by offering a new supply of rice and tarp for the tribe if one of the winners chooses to give up his/her share of the reward. Furthermore, being singled out due to the odd number of players, Dan was chosen to sit out in the challenge, but if he guessed the winning team correctly, he would join them at their reward. Dan guessed the winning team correctly, winning himself reward as well.
