Notes:^1 Tribal Council resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those involved in the tie.
^2 A deadlock tie occurred, but because it was the tribe's first Tribal Council, no previous votes could be taken into account. With this, a nature quiz challenge was held between the tied players to determine the elimination.
^3 Per Survivor rules, in case of a deadlock tie, past votes were taken into account. The player with more past votes would be eliminated.
^4 Ethan and Lex did not vote as they could only vote for were each other. By virtue of winning the final Immunity Challenge, only Kim J. voted.
