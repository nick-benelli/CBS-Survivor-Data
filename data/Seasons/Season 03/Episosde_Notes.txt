Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge
^2 The vote resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote would commence.
^3 A deadlock tie occurred, but because it was the tribe's first Tribal Council, no previous votes could be taken into account. With this, a nature quiz challenge was held between the tied players to determine the elimination.
^4 Per Survivor rules, in case of a deadlock tie, past votes were taken into account. The player with more past votes would be eliminated.
