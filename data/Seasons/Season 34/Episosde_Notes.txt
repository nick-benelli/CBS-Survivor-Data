Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.
^2 The two tribes that lost the Immunity Challenge were both sent to Tribal Council, where they would vote together to vote one person out.
^3 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
^4 As Debbie drew a package containing no buff, she was exiled without a tribe. Because of this, she did not attend Tribal Council and was immune for the episode.
^5 Jeff was voted out verbally by the Nuku tribe. He did not cast an elimination vote.
^6 All votes cast were negated, causing a null vote. Per the rules of Survivor, a vote restart occurred. However, as only one castaway could recieve votes, they were eliminated by default.
