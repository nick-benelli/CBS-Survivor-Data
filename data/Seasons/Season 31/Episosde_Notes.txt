Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.
^2 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
^3 All votes cast were negated, causing a null vote. Per the rules of Survivor, a vote restart occurred.
^4  Per Survivor rules, in case of a deadlock tie, the non-immmune players would have an open discussion to eliminate one of the tied players. If no consensus is reached, the non-immune castaways would be forced to draw rocks.
