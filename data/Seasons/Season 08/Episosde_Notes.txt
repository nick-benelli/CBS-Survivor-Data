Notes:

^1 In an act of goodwill, Saboga forfeited half of their reward so that the other two tribes also receive flint.
^2 Jenna M. quit the game before the Immunity Challenge, thus canceling the challenge. However, Mogo Mogo still went to Tribal Council to discuss Jenna's situation.
^3 Sue quit the game after a controversial incident with Richard during the previous Immunity Challenge.
^4 Combined Reward/Immunity Challenge.
^5 As part of Chapera's reward, they selected a member of Mogo Mogo to join them in their prize, thus exempting that castaway from Tribal Council. They chose Kathy.
^6 Pre-merge individual Reward Challenge; the tribes remained separate yet they competed in an individual challenge where the winner may pick two companions to join him on the reward, regardless of tribe.
^7 The Chaboga Mogo tribe was first divided into two teams of four, which then competed for a group reward, after which the winning team competed as individuals, this time for individual immunity.
