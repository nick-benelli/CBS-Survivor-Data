^3 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, however, no votes were cast against its user.
^4 Joe drew the odd-colored rock during the teams formation, and as a result automatically joined the winning team on reward without competing.
^5 The vote resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a revote would commence.
^8 Instead of a traditional vote, the person who won the Immunity Challenge, Chrissy, would choose someone to take with them into the final three. She chose to take Ryan with her, leaving the two remaining castaways, Ben and Devon to compete in a fire-making challenge to determine the last finalist.
