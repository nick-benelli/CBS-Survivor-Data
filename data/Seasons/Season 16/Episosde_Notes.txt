Notes:

^1 Combined Reward and Immunity Challenge.
^2 Before the Immunity Challenge, both tribes were tasked to send one member from the other tribe to Exile Island, preventing them from competing in the challenge. Although the person exiled from the losing tribe would attend the subsequent Tribal Council, they would be immune from being voted out.
^3 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.
