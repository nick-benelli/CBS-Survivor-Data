Notes:
^1 Tribal Council resulted in a tie. Per Survivor rules, a second vote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those involved in the tie.
^2 Per Survivor rules, in case of a deadlock tie, past votes were taken into account. The player with more past votes would be eliminated.
^3 Michael was medically evacuated after falling into the camp fire and severely burning his hands. No vote occurred for his removal.
^4 Keith and Tina did not vote as they could only vote for each other. By virtue of winning the final Immunity Challenge, only Colby voted.
