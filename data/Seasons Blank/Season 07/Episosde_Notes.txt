Notes:

^1 The Morgan tribe was instructed to pick a member of Drake who would go back to camp with them and not attend Tribal Council. They selected Rupert.
^2 Due to The Outcasts twist, this Tribal Council was held to vote people back into the game.
^3 Being the two returnees, Burton and Lillian received immunity on their next Tribal Council. Burton won the Immunity Challenge and could decide if he'd like to give his extra immunity, which he did to Rupert.^4 The jury took part in the Immunity Challenge and won, denying immunity to the remaining four survivors.
